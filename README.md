# LogicAndComputationFinal
My final project for CS2800 at Northeastern University is a collection of theorems which are proved using the ACL2 automatic theorem prover, a programming language based off of Common Lisp.

## Installation

Using any version of ACL2 which supports definec, import a completed proof file into any ACL2 project and run it in ACL2 mode. This will create an a2s file which shows the execution of the ACL2 proof.

All theorems in this project were created in a Vagrant environment in VirtualBox

## Project Status
This project pertains to the theorems in the Completed-Proofs folder of this repository. Anything in the Incomplete-Proofs folder has either not been proven yet or has been abandoned
